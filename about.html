            <p>The purpose of this web site is to demonstrate the mobile web, what features are available and what
            you need to consider when developing web solutions for mobile devices. The web pages and code here
            is only a compliment to books or other educational surroundings since there is not much text
            explaining what is shown.</p>
            <p>Besides touching (or clicking) around the site and trying out web pages, perhaps in different
            devices to see what might differ, you are also supposed to "View Source" and check out the html, css
            and JavaScript that made it all possible. That's why the source is also published on 
            <a href="http://github.com/mikeplate/Mobile-Web-Demo">GitHub</a></p>
            <p>Note that although the site was made for the mobile web, all web pages are compatible with those
            old devices known as "computers".</p>

            <p>This web site was made by me, Mike Plate. You can follow me on Twitter
            <a href="http://twitter.com/mikeplate">@mikeplate</a></p>
            <p>There is also a blog with infrequent posts <a href="http://mikeplate.com">mikeplate.com</a></p>
            <p>You can also try out CSS3 features on both the web and the mobile web at another site of mine
            <a href="http://css3.mikeplate.com">css3.mikeplate.com</a></p>

            <p>JavaScript code is simplified in several web pages with the library <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a></p>
            <p>jQuery was also extended for JSON and templating with <a href="http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl">jquery-tmpl</a>
                and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jquery-json/">jquery-json</a></p>
            <p>A book that helped me find things that should be included here was
            <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fCZB0yBckTgC">Programming the Mobile Web</a></p>
